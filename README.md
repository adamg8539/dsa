# **Data Structures and Algorithms**

### This is where I document my practice of Data Structures and Algorithms questions. I document my solutions here and add read me files to each solution explaining my solution and intuition behind it.

### Through research it is evident that python is one of the best languages to practice data structures and algorithms (dsa). It is also the language that is very often used in technical interviews. Thus I will be exploring all these problems in python.
