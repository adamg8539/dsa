# **Data Structures and Algorithms**

### This is where I document my practice of Data Structures and Algorithms questions. I document my solutions here and add read me files to each solution explaining my solution and intuition behind it.

### Through research it is evident that python is one of the best languages to practice data structures and algorithms (dsa). It is also the language that is very often used in technical interviews. Thus I will be exploring all these problems in python.

I found the following website which categorised the problems by their data structure used or type of algorithm used (www.bytebytego.com). I liked this approach a lot for the sake of learning as I could learn/re-learn that type of problem and then practice my knowledge upon other problems from the same category. Though there is one drawback to using this website which is that the test cases aren't as thorough as leetcode's. Thus once I am done with a problem on bytebytego, I search the problem on leetcode and copy my code and use their testcases. Another huge benefit leetcode has is it tracks your algorithm's runtime and memory requirements and displays the results in comparison to other people who have solved the problem. This really helps clarify how efficiently I have solved the problem in comparison to others.
